# Knockout JS

These are the slides / source code for a presentation I made covering the
excellent [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com).

This was presented at [DevTricks](http://softwareniagara.com/#devtricks) in
2014.

The presentation uses [Deck.js](https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js).

### Interesting Tidbit

I embed an iframe on slides that have code, creating an interactive example.
This is done without calling out to JSbin/JSFiddle.
